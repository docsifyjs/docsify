##### What this topic covers

- Basic intro to databases
- Where they are used
- Why use them
- Overview of database management systems (DBMS) and architecture
- Who uses databases
- Schema: conceptual, external, internal

- **Learning outcomes**:
 	- Understand why we need databases in the first place

## 3. Intro to SQL - **w2**

##### What this topic covers

- Brief intro to background of SQL
- SQL as propositions (‘statements of fact’) not creating and filling tables
- Declarative vs. imperative programming

- **Learning outcomes:**
 	- Contextualise forthcoming (My)SQL lectures which will cover:
  		- Creating tables, PK/FKs, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, JOINs, WHERE clauses, aliasing, subqueries, using functions
 	- Appreciate the differences in programming paradigms & how this relates to how one writes SQL
 	- Be aware of some inconsistencies in MySQL’s implementation of SQL

## 4. The relational model - **w2**

##### What this topic covers

- Types of database / data models: hierarchical, network, relational
- Origins of the relational model
- Key(!) features of the relational model, e.g., relations, attributes, keys
- Keys as distinctive driver of relational model
- Referential integrity of the relational model

- **Learning outcomes**:
 	- What we mean by relational vs. other database paradigms
 	- Basic structural components of relations / relational model
 	- Why keys are critical to (distinctive of) the relational model (+JOIN)
 	- The implications of keys for data integrity

- Techniques for gathering requirements
- Good vs. bad requirements
- Types of requirements
- Why generate requirements?
- Requirements vs. needs
- Stakeholders are not just ‘users’

- Introduce the need for Entity-Relationship (ER) Modelling
- ER Modelling basics:
 	- Entities
 	- Attributes
 	- Relationships
 	- Cardinality
- Working ER examples from description to diagram
- How ER diagrams map to relational databases

- **Learning outcomes:**
 	- Identifying entities
 	- Identifying attributes
 	- Identifying relationships and their cardinality
 	- Mapping ER diagrams to relational database elements

## 7. SQL basics, SELECTs and JOINs - **w3**

##### What this topic covers

- Create tables
- Datatypes
- SQL Constraints
- Drop table
- Insert, edit and delete data in the tables
- Select data from table(s) (Single table/Multiple tables)
