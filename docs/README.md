# docsify

> A magical documentation site generator.

## What it is

Docsify turns your Markdown files into a documentation website instantly. Unlike most other documentation site generator tools, it doesn't need to create html files. Instead, it dynamically loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as a website. To get started, just create an `index.html` file and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](deploy.md) (for more details see our [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide).

## Features
