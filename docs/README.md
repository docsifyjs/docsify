## docsify

> A magical documentation site generator.

## What is it

docsify generates your documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as website. All you need to do is create an `index.html` to start and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](/deploy).

See the [Quick start](/quickstart) for more details.

## Features

- No statically built html files
- Simple and lightweight (~14kB gzipped)
- Smart full-text search plugin
- Multiple themes
- Useful plugin API
- Compatible with IE10+
